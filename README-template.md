## My process
Starting framing everything through HTML then started 
styling in CSS. 
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

What I learned was being able to do a:hover to give a different color when hovering over the button. Learned also the box-shadow and how it can make the hovering effect more effective and eyecatching.
Also learned to use the transform property when scaling in and changing the size of the image without changing its width and height.
Also learned how to get real specific with the elements such as defining the elements, the class, and the action for that specific element/class.


### Continued development

Some thing I still need to refine is the overall structure and the apprirpiate classes and elements when organizing to style with CSS. I also will continue to learn about mobile repsonsiveness as well as I was having difficulties doing that and not completely satisfied with mobile but still learning.
